Under the motto \"Pioneering Aerospace\" the #ILA22 will take place for the first time at the newly opened BER Airport in the heart of Europe. The German Aerospace Industries Association (BDLI) as ILA brand owner and Messe Berlin GmbH as organizer are expecting trade visitors from all over the world, high-ranking guests from international, European and German politics and of course the numerous visitors of the public days in Berlin for the first time in four years - finally ILA is happening again!<br />\r\nAfter the cancellation of the last edition in 2020 due to the pandemic and the opening of BER in the fall of the same year, #ILA22 now opens in a new format. The ticket store for the visitor days (trade audience and general public) will go online as early as April 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Germany and Europe are to become the hub of climate-neutral flying</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With its Aviation, Space, Defence &amp; Support and Supplier sections, ILA Berlin covers the entire value chain and is one of the leading international trade fairs for the aerospace industry. As a public trade show, it opens its doors on two visitor days on the weekend of June 25 and 26, for trade professionals already from June 22. The main topics of #ILA22 are innovations in the areas of climate-neutral flying, new mobility and safety in space. Volker Thum, Chief Executive Officer of the BDLI, said, \"ILA Berlin and thus our high-tech industry are living up to their pioneering spirit. We are drivers of sustainable mobility. Germany and Europe must become pioneers of climate-neutral flying. We have the know-how to develop and manufacture the first climate-neutral aircraft. The ILA is also Europe's most visited space trade show. Here it becomes clear why investment in space travel is indispensable and which all-embracing added value arises from it. Space travel fascinates, connects and protects.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Ecknig, CEO of Messe Berlin, said, \"We are delighted to finally bring the aerospace industry together again live in Berlin. With our new hybrid concept, we want to combine the best of two worlds: the live experience to exchange ideas in person and an up-close experience of aerospace industry innovations supplemented by digital offerings such as live streams of the congress program to allow those who can't be on-site to participate in ILA Berlin.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For the first time at ILA: Digital platform for trade visitors, STAGES and dedicated career days</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly created Digital Platform pursues the goal of sharing future-oriented topics in aviation and aerospace with as many people as possible. It features an exhibitor service for product presentation, communication, matchmaking, lead generation as well as modern streaming technology. Other special features of #ILA22 are the so-called STAGES, which will be placed directly in the four halls. Whether ILA Future Lab or Advanced Air Mobility - a total of five live STAGES will present the future topics of aerospace. In addition, special career days will also be held during the public days. These are aimed at students, trainees and young professionals as well as experienced professionals and people from outside the industry who are looking for a new career. Further announcements on the new Career Centre will follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, #ILA22 shows the transformation of civil aviation towards climate neutrality: Here, technologies and sustainable aviation fuels research, aircraft and their propulsion devices as well as the digitalization of the industry become visible and tangible. The flight program also focuses on innovation and is integrated into the flight operations of the BER with selected demonstrations. The most visited space exhibition in Europe highlights the benefits of discoveries made in space for the benefit of the earth. The focus of space travel is on its indispensable contributions to a modern, sustainable, secure and digital future - it is key to climate protection and prevention, for example through satellite communication and earth observation. A special highlight is the Space Pavilion of the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the companies of the German space industry represented in the BDLI.<br />\r\nOther future topics at #ILA22 include the diverse use of drones, urban air traffic with air cabs, and digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and 3D printing. The further development of the European air combat system FCAS is an industrial policy focus at #ILA22.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-entity data-align=\"center\" data-embed-button=\"media_entity_embed\" data-entity-embed-display=\"view_mode:media.embedded\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d2c36dce-10e7-4c29-bce3-7703217be032\"></drupal-entity>\r\n"
